## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/foxlau/react-router-v7-better-auth.git
pnpm install
```

### Development

Run an initial database migration:

```bash
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
cp wrangler.jsonc.example wrangler.jsonc
pnpm db:apply
pnpm db:seed
```

If you modify the Drizzle ORM schema, please run `pnpm db:generate` first. If you need to delete the generated SQL migrations, execute `pnpm db:drop` and select the SQL migration you wish to remove.

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Database Commands

- `pnpm db:generate` - Generate new database migration files
- `pnpm db:apply` - Apply migrations to local database
- `pnpm db:apply-prod` - Apply migrations to production database
- `pnpm db:drop` - Remove generated SQL migrations (interactive)
- `pnpm db:seed` - Seed local database with initial data from `app/lib/database/seed.sql`
- `pnpm db:seed-prod` - Seed production database with initial data from `app/lib/database/seed.sql`

#### Default Users (from seed.sql)
- **Regular User**: `john@example.com` / `user@9900`
- **Admin User**: `admin@example.com` / `admin@8899`

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
pnpm build
```

## Deployment

Deployment is done using the Wrangler CLI.

Use the following commands to create the D1 database and KV cache for Better Auth sessions. Remember to replace the `db` and `kv` configurations in the `wrangler.toml` file with the data generated by these commands:

```bash
npx wrangler d1 create rr7-better-auth
npx wrangler kv namespace create APP_KV
```

To deploy directly to production:

```sh
pnpm db:apply-prod
pnpm deploy
```

To deploy a preview URL:

```sh
pnpm deploy:version
```

You can then promote a version to production after verification or roll it out progressively.

```sh
pnpm deploy:promote
```
